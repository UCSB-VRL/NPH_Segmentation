# NPH Segmentation
## ðŸ˜ƒ Hazel's branch ðŸ˜ƒ
### originally from Fei's module
---

### I. How to run code

```python
python3 main.py
```

### II. Basic Description 

**What we need** : data-split/Scans/{filename}.nii.gz
**Skull stripping result will be stored in** : data-split/skull-strip/{filename}_Mask.nii.gz
**Final segment result will be stored in** : reconstructed/ventreconstructed_{filename}.nii.gz


### III. Brief Step by Step Description

```
1. Do skull stripping 
2. Get reconstructed_{filename}.nii.gz which only can distinguish CSF from ventricle and subarachnoid
3. Find a slice number which has a maximum area of [ventricle + subarachnoid]
4. For 7 slices based on max-area slide, distinguish subarachnoid from ventricle by connecting subarachnoid to skull (in 3D)
```

### IV. Progress

```
1. Use BET result instead of ground truth (manually segmented file) -> done
2. Caculating Dice score with result image -> on progress
3. Future work will be focused on figuring out how to do 4 classes segmentation for whole slices, not only 7 slices.
