# NPH Segmentation
---

## Hazel's branch
### originally from Fei's module

I. How to run code

'''
python3 main.py
'''

II. Basic Description 

'''
What we need : data-split/Scans/{filename}.nii.gz
Skull stripping result will be stored in : data-split/skull-strip/{filename}_Mask.nii.gz
Final segment result will be stored in : reconstructed/ventreconstructed_{filename}.nii.gz
'''

III. Brief Step by Step Description

'''
1. Do skull stripping 
2. Get reconstructed_{filename}.nii.gz which only can distinguish CSF from ventricle and subarachnoid
3. Find a slice number which has a maximum area of [ventricle + subarachnoid]
4. For 7 slices based on max-area slide, distinguish subarachnoid from ventricle by connecting subarachnoid to skull (in 3D)
'''

IV. Progress

'''
1. These codes don't need **final segmented files** which are ground truth files.
2. Future work will be focused on figuring out how to do 4 classes segmentation for whole slices, not only 7 slices.
